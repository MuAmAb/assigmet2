ITS DELAYS TO REFLECT THE MONEY ONCE YOU TRANSFER FROM BANK ACCOUNT TO STCPAY.. KINDLY SOLVE THIS ISSUE AND MINIMIZE THE DELAY TO 5MIN..THANKS;Positive

The refunds from cancelled orders took a long time to be reversed. I ordered from iherb and I cancelled by mistake at the same moment in which the money should be reversed at the same moment. But unfortunately stcpay wanted me to wait 5-7 days. However I offered them to give the reference number for the refund operation. I also received a picture about the refund as proof but still they wanted me to wait 5 to 7 day and my money still pending.;Negative

I have been using this app for more than 1 year i analyzed this  and when you are checking the exchange rate for example they ll show you Sar 1 = Pkr 74.71 .when you ll transfer your money then they ll give you change the rate to 74.66 or less.. and transfer fees also higher than other apps believe me this is completely unacceptable and cheating with people's. They should not play like this. I believe SAR 17.25 transfer fees is enough. ... this is already too much .;Negative

Very delayed transfer. International transfer time is 46 hours max. Once u complaint then they will rase ticket by saying it will be resolved in 5 days . So total 7 days you will suffer with different complaints. And you are lucky if your money delivered in 7 days . Other wise complaint again and again wait for 7 days .;Negative

Update: Now it doesn't even work with my tablet.I can't use it anymore on my phone-for some reason the app doesnt recognize that I have the location option enabled. There is no web application to circumvent ones inability to access the application via a smartphone. I am currently using is via my old tablet. To think that the minds at STC would not consider providing alternative access options is mind boggling. Either remove the location prerequisite or offer a web application as an alternative.;Negative

Needs tons of fixes. As a quick comment: 1. There is no way to get a statement manually or automated. 2. Opening a ticket isn't a pleasant experience at all to the level you wonder if they intentionally made it that way. 3. There is no way to search for transactions between you and other person. This is really stupid considering this app is primarily intended for peer to peer transactions!;Negative

Calling the customer support will not help you resolve things they will just simple say sorry for the delay we have to wait for 48 hours unfortunately after 5 days still the issue not resolve. Cancelling the transaction due to very delayed process is not possible for bank transfer. Very poor in resolving the issues.;Negative

Very poor customer service! I had raised a ticket for wrong debit from my account on 14th of August 2022 and still the problem is not solved. Every time i call to follow up with customer service i get a response that they are working on the problem raised a claim number and it will be solved soon without giving any specific time. I am afraid for correction of wrong debits would take years for them to solve. Totally disappointed!;Negative

Why STC PAY have Poor customer service sine long time ago???? Can you change the customer service team who can do better service and response as well?? You guys really don't have responsibility at all. The app is pretty nice customer service team and operation team members are worst...👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 Guys better use another option instead of STC PAY Guys don't use STC pay it will hold your money for long periods and slow customer services Better use alrajhi sabb alinmaenjaz for express sv;Positive

First of all I didn't get the idea that why you demand verification despite the fact that my sim and id is already verified biometrically. Secondly I didn't get the idea that there are so many apps like absher tawakkalna Eatmarna Nafath etc and all apps are identical in their nature so isn't it possible that these all apps should be merge in only one app so evey time don't need to install and verify different apps. I pledge to not use stc pay never ever in my life;Positive

Its hard to take your money if you are in final exit. They will close your sim and you will spend a lot moneycalling them for help... They will just say its on progress... 16 days now and still my money in the app... I hope they will show mercy... 1 assistant is hurrying...;Positive

I've been using this app for quite long time already and really appreciate it's features. However this is the same issue I encountered for the second time ever since. I send an international remittance last Saturday 13-Aug-22 to my beneficiary's bank account but until now the status is still UNDER PROCESS which is almost a week already. I log on the STC Help & Support desk for the issue but no respond yet from STC Pay as of now.;Positive
Before it was good but became worst. I sent money since 13/8/22 until now my money still not received by my beneficiary. I contacted them but keep on telling under maintenance. They will solve 24-48hours but look how many days now. Keep on telling they will solve as soon as they can. But what happened now. What if we badly needed the money for emergency purposes? This is inconvenience. I thought they make this app to give convenience and easy sending of money but they proved me wrong.;Negative
Worst app ever!! My transaction is on hold 4days now when I contact customer service team no one was able to track my transaction. They keep on telling to wait until now haven't gotten my money.;Negative

First month i am using this i sent money to Pakistan but from 3 days i m waiting for it's receiving in Pakistan.;Negative
The app has been deteriorating in every aspect. Login. Payment. Transaction history.. everything ... It takes a real master to screw things up soo perfectly. Login page stuck with new update. New update for stcpay is a real pain. It's horribly slooow stuck every time i open it. Getting the confirmation sms takes ages ... soooo disappointing;Negative

I send some money to emergency hospital case in India 12/08/2022. It's hold and customer care service is very poor response.. I hate this app and I never ever used not me all my friends and and relatives uninstall this app. Good bye STC pay And welcome other service ..;Positive
Very bad help and support section... There must be a numbers to call so customer's can easily contact with any of your agents when we need some assistance not just only a chatting room with an irresponsible agents. Zero star but in order to post this review I must put one what a wise idea 😕.... Nothings change bad customer services...agents are too lousy especially in replying... Chat or call very poor services;Negative

My transfer is on hold since 4 days you are requesting Id card. But due to an Error in your app i can't attach ID card.Attach button works in iPhone only. What your IT team is doing???? This issue is from one and half year in all android mobiles. Your customer service is null. And your service is null as well. Some time you deliver mony in one minute. But if it went on hold will take more then 15 days to fix or return your mony. This is my last time will never use your service again. Bye stcpay;Negative

Transferring to a local bank is a nightmare. Takes forever to receive the pin code to complete the transfer and take years to be received in the local bank. Now I can't add money with my master card.

Make your uploading ID(on hold transaction)button work it doesn't workfix it. And your customer service sucks. They don't know to fix any issues. They only tell the information that is already in the app. The customer can see that. Just check everything works on your application so we don't have to deal with your customer service who doesn't do anything. Thank you.;Negative

Worst app.. Added a beneficiary. STC Pay approved it. I sent money. They blocked my money and asked for his passport and many other details. I asked them to cancel the transaction since I cannot provide them the passport copy. Then they processed the payment. Such a pathetic service. It seems like they purposefully block the money for their benefit. NEVER TRUST THIS APP IF YOU ARE SENDING THE MONEY FOR EMERGENCY USE. Urpay is far far better than this.;Negative

Refund from ecommerce purchase is taking so much time the amazon and ebay has given reference number still taking so much time to credit back. The other banks cards are not like stc pay they usually credit within few days. I am unable to create ticket and follow up this complain.

More than 1000 sar is not yet credited back.;Positive

With the new update I dont know why the send money was not converted from sar to peso. I send 74sar and the problem is when i send the transaction information to the receiver it shows that i send 74pesos which is ironically incorrect.. transaction in the stc pay system 74sar excluding the remittance fee of 17sar hope it will not have any problem to my receiver.. Hope so..;Neutral
